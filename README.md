# Cancer Genomics Workflows for the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC)

This repo contains accessible, interactive, and cloud-enabled workflows that support the analyses of data from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) [Genomic Data Commons (GDC)](https://gdc.cancer.gov/).  In particular, these workflows are designed to run in the [Biodepot-workflow-builder (Bwb)](https://github.com/BioDepot/BioDepot-workflow-builder) platform. Bwb is a user-friendly graphical platform for building and executing bioinformatics workflows that uses software containers to ensure reproducibility and facilitate installation and execution of workflows. 

These workflows and documentation are developed by: Ling-Hong Hung, Robert Schmitz, Bryce Fukuda, KV Le, Anthony Nguyen, and Ka Yee Yeung at Biodepot LLC; Varik Hoang and Wes Lloyd at University of Washington.
